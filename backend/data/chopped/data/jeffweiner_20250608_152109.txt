I have been in the data / analytics / data science / insights / marketing research space for my entire career, and most recently have spent time in AI. I build and lead high performing teams and systems to support analysis of all types of data. My work drives top line revenue growth and bottom line profitability by using analytics and research to reduce risk in brand and product development, optimization of staffing levels, improved relevance of marketing campaigns, and creation of key insights to identify new markets, among others.
Here are some examples:
- Autura:  My team and I built a cloud-based customer data platform that integrated data from multiple applications and created a single, well documented source of truth.  We topped it off with a powerful but easy to use business intelligence tool that was widely adopted by users.
- InsightRidge: Analytics across a client's customer base found over-mailing of the same catalogs to the same customers saving the client over $7 million per year.
- Capella University: A research study I championed provided confidence to maintain pricing levels on our largest and most degree profitable program despite a new competitor entering the market with tuition that was 20% lower. This study was designed, executed, and presented in less than 72 hours.
- Carlson Marketing: Analysis of a client's campaign performance identified an opportunity to increase trans-Atlantic business class segments by 4 percentage points.
I have experience in many industries, including automotive, consumer packaged goods (CPG), higher education, financial services, retail, technology (including SaaS), airlines, hotel, and gaming industries.
Specialties: data, business intelligence, marketing, strategy, CRM, loyalty, marketing data, marketing analytics, predictive modeling, customer segmentation, customer lifetime value modeling, quantitative marketing research, qualitative research, customer experience management, digital marketing, marketing measurement, marketing attribution, big data, consumer behavior, economic modeling, marketing economics, financial modeling, team leadership, strategy, strategic planning, client management, analytics engineering, dbt, thoughtspot, snowflake, big query, aws, AI, google cloud platform, big query, data strategy, azure, power bi

One of the crazier AI applications that caught my eye this week: using ChatGPT's recommendations to befriend crows. "The Crows know who I am and are interested" wasn't on my AI bingo card for 2025. ðŸ¤–ðŸ¦…

At Autura, I led data and analytics efforts for a fast-growing SaaS provider serving government agencies and the towing industry. I supported both internal teams and external municipal clients, as well as configuration of our flagship software for customers. My team and I used dbt, Snowflake, and Thoughspot to build data and analytics products for consumption across the organization. We also partnered with our AWS team to execute Gen AI pilots for our auction business.
â€¢ Cloud-Based Data Integration: Managed the successful transition from multiple legacy tech stacks for data and reporting to an integrated, cloud-based customer data and insights platform. Utilized Airbyte for ELT, Snowflake, dbt in AWS for data engineering, and Thoughtspot for business intelligence.
â€¢ Implemented Data Monetization Strategy: Partnered with sales and engineering teams to develop and implement a data monetization strategy and repeatable notification process for first notice of loss.
â€¢ Streamlined Client Onboarding: Took over configuration team and partnered with the implementation team to reduce new client configuration, enhancing operational efficiency, and client satisfaction.

At One10, a company focused on improving productivity through sales incentives, training, employee recognition, incentive travel, and large-scale events, I led the analytics and research team. We leveraged SAS, Tableau, PowerBI, and Azure AI/Machine Learning to provide data-driven insights to clients.  My key contributions include:
â€¢	Developed a novel sales channel analytics framework: This framework optimized sales and profitability by enabling just-in-time training, recognition, and incentive programs for sales teams.
â€¢	Led IT infrastructure modernization: I partnered with IT to migrate our analytics environment to an Azure-based data and analytics platform, cutting costs by 63% while improving reliability and functionality.
â€¢	Established industry thought leadership: I frequently presented research and insights at major industry events, including closing keynotes at the 2016 SITE Global Meeting (Panama City) and a deep-dive session on training's impact on incentive travel at the 2019 SITE Global Meeting (Bangkok). I also actively participated in regional and national ISPI, SITE Young Leaders, and IMEX conferences.

Jeff possesses a unique combination of analytical insight and sound business judgement. He's a true thought partner with a intent focus on bringing solutions to his stakeholders. He masters the details while sharing thoughtful, meaningful stories and examples that lead to actionable insights. Beyond that, he's a genuine person and a wonderful colleague. Even though it's been years since we worked together, I still remember the wonderful wit and humor he brought to every team he was a part of.

Jeff is one of a kind. Not only is he a great human, but also a really smart guy who works hard to meet you where youâ€™re at from a technical perspective. Any company out there would be lucky to have him on their team. Heâ€™ll do what it takes to get the job done, even if the solution might seem cumbersome. I really enjoyed my time working with him. He cares a lot about the individuals he works side by side with, his team, and the clients he serves.

Katie was the best summer intern ever, an "above average" laser tag player, and a willing participant in shenanigans involving roast beef sandwiches.  We interviewed a number of candidates but Katie was head and shoulders above the rest. She brought an outsider's view of the work we were doing and quickly contributed based on her fresh perspective.  Perhaps the strongest testament is that we are still leveraging the work Katie did several months later.  5/5 stars, would recommend for data science roles.

Susan has reported to me for the past few years.  In that time, she has gone from being a technical whiz, creating amazing integrations between SAS and Microsoft Office, to being a great manager as well.  She has done a great job of managing the P & L of her primary account as well as leading an expanded team of people across Aimia through influence, rather than a direct reporting relationship, to achieve huge goals. Susan would be a great asset to any analytics group.

Organized food truck visits to my neighborhood each week during the pandemic.  Achieved all three goals:  1) Help small businesses (food trucks) survive the pandemic. 2) Get neighbors together in a safe way.  3) I could get dinner from my favorite food trucks that I very much missed by walking no further than the end of my driveway.
