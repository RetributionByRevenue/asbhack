Abbie managed creative services projects and clients with unrivaled expertise.  It's difficult to keep all details on track working with demanding clients and various production and budgetary limitations, but Abbie consistently worked effectively with our production staff to create quality product under deadline.  It helps in a highly stressful environment to have people who are highly motivated yet sincerely amiable.  It was a pleasure working with Abbie.
